# Sun-Tracking-System
A mini project hat helped me get exposure and learn about a microcontrollers
In recent years, the energy sources like fossil fuel, gas, crude oil, coal, nuclear fuel, etc,. are becoming scared due to excessive use of it for domestic as well as commercial purposes. These are non-renewal sources of energy. The situation was energy resources are scared, so it is vital to use renewable sources of energy for example solar energy, Wind power, Tides, Hydroelectricity, and Geothermal power. A solar tracking system produces more energy since the solar panel remains aligned to the sun. The uses of alternative sources of energy are becoming widely spread all over the world. Our sun is also a very good source of different energies; light energy has a very remarkable value. The Solar panel converts the light energy into electrical energy. The efficiency of solar panels can be maximized by aligning the solar panel with the sun. The sun tracking system designed in this project offers a reliable and affordable method of aligning a solar panel with the sun on a single axis. This project is based on microcontroller 8051 with a simple circuit and sun tracking software.
